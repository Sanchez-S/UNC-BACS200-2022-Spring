# Project 09 - Project Portfolio (Part 1)

### Complete the Design Reviews

1. Confirm what 2 peer sites you have been assigned to review
2. Verify that the following pages exist on the site (they don't necessarily have to be hyperlinked anywhere on the site, just exist):
    *	index.html
    *	inspire.html
    *	amuse.html
    *	educate.html
    *	profile.html
    *	superhero.html
    *	template.html
    *	wanted.html
    *	test.html
3. Compile anonymous feedback for those peers based on the following criteria:
    * A stylesheet exists that is linked to all pages of the site (multiple stylesheets per page are allowed)
    *	Said stylesheet includes at least one non-standard web font
    *	The code for each page follows the best practices listed in chapter 4.5
    *	Each page is free of errors according to the [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org)
4. Provide anonymous feedback on design choices (please refrain from providing any feedback on the content or subject matter)
5. Email all your findings and feedback to me (steven.sanchez@unco.edu)
