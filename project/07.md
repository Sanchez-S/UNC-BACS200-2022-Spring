# Project 7 - Wanted Poster

## GOALS

Learn to use CSS to style web pages with common properties.

## STEPS

1. Create a page "bacs200/wanted.html" with a linked stylesheet
    * use semantic tags (header, main, footer)
2. Select a superhero or villain for your poster
    * add an image of them to the main section of the page
3. Add in necessary text elements explaining that the person is wanted for committing certain crimes
4. Link to a stylesheet that incorporates at least 3 CSS rules with different properties.  Here are some suggestions:
  * Center the header, main, footer on page
  * Create one inch margin around the page
  * Create a block of text on the side of the page
  * Set the background color and padding on main and footer
  * Create colored border around a text box
  * Use a CSS variable to reference a custom color
  * Assign a relative font size to the header of the page
